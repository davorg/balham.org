Balham, nestled in south-west London, has a history stretching back over
1,000 years. Its name derives from the Anglo-Saxon *Bealhām*, meaning
“homestead in a rounded enclosure.” First recorded in a land charter from
the year 957, the area was mostly rural farmland for centuries.

In the 19th century, Balham was transformed by the arrival of the railways.
Balham Station opened in 1856, and from that point, the area rapidly
urbanised as commuters moved in. Victorian and Edwardian terraces sprang up,
many of which still line the streets today.

In 1876, Balham became the centre of one of Victorian England’s most
notorious unsolved crimes. Charles Bravo, a barrister living at The Priory
on Bedford Hill, died after ingesting a fatal dose of antimony. Despite
widespread media coverage and two inquests, no one was ever charged with the
murder. The case remains one of Britain’s most enduring true crime mysteries,
casting a long shadow over The Priory and its legacy.


One of Balham’s most famous buildings is **Du Cane Court**, a striking Art
Deco block of flats built in the 1930s. It was the largest privately owned
block of flats in Europe at the time and reportedly spared bombing in WWII
because the Luftwaffe planned to use it as officers' quarters.

Balham has also gained a cult following from its comedic references — most
notably in the 1949 spoof travelogue “Balham: Gateway to the South,” made
famous by Peter Sellers.

Today, Balham blends village charm with cosmopolitan style — a thriving
neighbourhood full of independent shops, cafés, and a strong sense of
community.
